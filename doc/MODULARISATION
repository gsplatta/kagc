KAGC will ideally be a program which accepts text input in a sort of "math mode" 
on the worksheet and is capable of symbolic manipulation and graphing of functions.

1.	API
	There should be an API which allows for custom functions and operations to be defined.
	Therefore, KAGC should have a very simple language to define functions and the operations
	which can be performed on them. For example, a Trigonometric Module would define the
	derivative and integral, maybe among other operations, for the trigonometric functions. 

2.	Parser
	The parser

3.	Graphics
	The graphics module will require output from funcional modules to have a specific defined
	format.
